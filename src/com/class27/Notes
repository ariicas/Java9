Final Keyword:
Final is a keyword in java that belongs to non acess modifiers
we can use final keyword with variables, methods and classes
with variables:
when used with variables we can not change the content of that variables;
but if that variable points to an array or another object we can change the content of that
array or object.

class a {
int number;
String name;

A(int number, String name ){
this.number=number;
this.name=name;
}
final A var1=new A(12345,"Bryan")
var1.number=100;
var1=new a(45678,"alex);
final int [] arr={123,334,234}

arr=={122,2334}=cant do this CE
arr[0]=789- we can change the varaible in the index
}}

Final Keywords with methods :
class parent {
final void printInfo(){  //so no extend if the parent has final keyword
sout"from parent"
}
}
class Child extends from Parent {
@override
void printInfo (){
sout"from Child" //ce Can not override a final method
}}
// i can use the child object with final.

final with class:
final class ABC{

void method1(){

}
}
no class can extend this class.

Abstraction:
in abstraction the internal details of the methods are hidden and we only expose
the signature of the methods with return types.
Rules:
we can not create object of the abstract classes why because the abstract classes
they are incomplete.
