Recap:
Overloading:
is a mechanism in java that allow us to have methods with same name but with diffrent
number of parameters or different type of parameters or with different sequence of
parameters;
example:
void hello(String name) {
-->by changing the number of parameters;
}
void hello(char [] name{
-->overloading by changing the datatype
}
void hello(char [] name, string address) {
-->overloading by changing the sequence of parameters
}
Rules:
1.we can overload methods in the same class;
2.Name of the method should be the same
3.we can not overload a method by just changing the return type.
4. if we have an overloaded method Java will perform auto widening to call and method but
not narrowing
example:
void add(int a,int b){}

add (10,10) but not add(10.5,10.5) CE ERROR

void add (double a, double b) {}
add (10,10) add (10.5,10.5) NO issue;

if we are not sure about the number of arguments we can use var args to pass
any number of parameters to a method.

void(int ... numbers){

for(int number: numbers){
syso.(number)
}
access modifiers do not effect the method overloading in the same class.

1(can we overload main method?
yes we can if we follow the overloading rules.
Can we overload the static methods
yes we can if we follow the overloading rules.
