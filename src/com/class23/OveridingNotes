when same thod with same returh tyoe and same signature(name,parameters)
exist in two classes which have inheritance relationship.

when we have same methods in the parent child classes with static modifier we say that we are hiding a method

OVERIDING;
when we have methods in parent and child classes
1. there should be a parent child relationship between the classes.
2.the return type, name and parameters of the method they should be the same.
3.we can not overide private methods/constructor because they  dont participate in inheritance
4.we can not decrease the visility of method being overwritten but we can increase.
5. when it comes to static methods we say that we are redeclaring a method instead of overiding it.
child methods calls first and then parent if child is not there
